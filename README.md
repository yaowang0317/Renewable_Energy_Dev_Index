# Solar_Energy_Development_Status
Explore the current solar development status quo in the United States

The raw data is from national solar radiation database,  and it is accessed through an API. It has extensive raw data for the past 20 years, which includes the temperature, solar irradiation, wind speed, location and so on. Each feature is in its own dataset and each one is as large as 70GB! Iâ€™m really interested in finding out how solar radiation changes across the same year at different places. So I took 4 cities as a sample: NYC, Seattle, San Diego and Miami. As we can see the solar irradiation changes a lot for all of the cities throughout the year, which makes a lot of sense as we are in the north hemisphere, and will get more sunshine in the summer.  We can see distinctively that San Diego and Miami has overall better solar irradiation, however, the difference is more severe in the winter/spring time.

I then find out how the irradiation difference will look like at the different time in the same location. So I take NYS as a sample, pick the hottest time in the year of 2017 and 2007, and find out the difference is more or less evenly distributed across the state.
